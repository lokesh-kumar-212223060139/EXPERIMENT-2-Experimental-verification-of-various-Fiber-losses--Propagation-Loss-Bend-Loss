# EXPERIMENT-2-OPTICAL-COMMUNICATION
## 🔍 EX.NO: 2 – Verification of Fiber Losses

**Aim:**  
To measure propagation and bending losses for two wavelengths in plastic fiber.

**Equipments Required:**  
- Link-B Kit  
- Patch chords  
- Oscilloscope  
- Function Generator  
- Fiber cables 

**Theory:**  
- Losses due to absorption, scattering, bending  
- Plastic fiber loss ~180 dB/km  
- Bending loss increases with reduced loop diameter  

**Procedure:**  
- Setup for 660nm and 950nm measurements  
- Measure output voltages for 1m and 3m fibers  
- Calculate attenuation \( a \) using:  
V1/V2 = e [ -a (L1+L2 ) ] 
- Bend fiber and record output vs diameter  

**Tabulation:**

**Result:**  
Attenuation and bending loss characteristics verified.
